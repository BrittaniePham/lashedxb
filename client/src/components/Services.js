              Waxing is one of the most commonly used methods of hair removal. For those of you who donâ€™t know, this technique basically consists of extracting hair from below the surface of the skin, making it detach from the follicle easier.  In spite of the different techniques that exist and that have sprouted up, waxing continues to be preferred, as its effects are longer-lasting than other methods of hair removal, such as shaving, and it is very easy to apply.

                  Long, thick and full eyelashes are desired by many women and often seen on the
                  pages of many beauty magazines. Unfortunately, we are not all genetically blessed 
                  with perfect lashes.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  By attaching synthetic hairs to your individual natural eyelashes with a 
                  special adhesive, you can get fabulous looking eyes that will make you stand out in a crowd.  
                  Lash extensions applied by a Certified Lash technician, can be costly, and although 
                  some lash stylists offer lash extensions dirt cheap, you get what you pay for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not to worry,
                  after making this investment in yourself, the many benefits will quickly remind you why 
                  you did it.
